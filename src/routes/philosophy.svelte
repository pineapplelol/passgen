    Passwords are used multiple times a day, but have you thought out how your
    password is generated? Do you use a simple password like ‘password’, or do
    you use a string of random letts and characters that you can barely
    remember. This platform was inspired by an XKCD, which brings

  <h2>Chances of Hacking</h2>

  <p>
    Most of the time if your passwords are compromised, its not because your
    passwords were cracked. Instead, it is because it was sniped off the
    internet – whether it come from a data breach for a service you use, logging
    in over Starbucks wifi, or falling prone to a phishing attack. To this
    degree, the strength of your password is less important than how you keep
    it. Even if your password can be cracked in 100 tries, services you use will
    throttle the number of login attempts anyways. That means if a user cannot
    login after 4 tries, they will suspend anymore login attempts. In this case,
    the tradeoff between ease of memory and strength of the password can become
    more balanced.

  <h2>How Is Strength Calculated</h2>

  <p>
    Calculating entropy. there are 2 ways - look at the whole character set
    (which is an incorrect way). or we can consider rainbow dictionary attacks.
    consider the size of the word dictionary set (currently at 7000). From this
    we calculate we use the scale:
